# hi!

I made contribution to Vs. Dave and Bambi's repo (somehow).

I was somehow the new owner for the [Vs. Dave 2.5 source code](https://github.com/fuseishere813/vsdave) for when it was privated.

I love music, producing for 2 years, and improving over time.

i also chart and maybe other stuff for a few mods, and code for my own mod too.
